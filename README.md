HR Analytics: Predicting Employee Attrition

This project explores an HR dataset to analyze employee attrition using data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization techniques. The goal is to identify patterns and trends in workforce behavior, with a focus on reducing attrition through actionable insights.

📌 Problem Statement

Attrition is a major challenge in many organizations. By leveraging HR analytics, we can uncover hidden trends in employee data and predict potential attrition cases. This enables HR departments to proactively intervene and retain key talent.

✅ Tasks Covered

🔧 Data Cleaning

📈 Insights
-Visualization reveals strong correlations between Overtime, Job Role, and Total Working Years with employee attrition.

-Gender and Business Travel also show some relation with attrition behavior.

-Overtime tends to be more prevalent among certain age groups, influencing attrition risk.

🔍 Key Findings:
-Overtime is a critical factor in attrition:

-Employees who work overtime are significantly more likely to leave the company.

-There's a visible correlation between overtime and both age and job role.

-Job Role & Department influence attrition:

-Certain roles (e.g., Sales Executive, Research Scientist) show higher attrition rates.

-Job role combined with long working hours and travel frequency impacts employee satisfaction.

-Marital Status and Business Travel matter:

-Single employees and those who travel frequently tend to have higher attrition rates.

-Frequent business travel is a possible stress factor.

Work Experience Trends:

-Employees with fewer total working years or those who’ve worked in many companies show higher attrition.

-Distance from home and number of companies worked are good predictors of dissatisfaction or instability.

-Gender and Education Field have minimal direct effect:

-Attrition is not heavily skewed by gender or education field alone.

Other factors (like work-life balance and job satisfaction) are stronger drivers.

📌 Overall Conclusion:
The analysis reveals that work-life balance, job role stressors, and personal factors like travel and marital status are significant contributors to employee attrition. These findings can help HR teams:

-Focus retention strategies on high-risk groups

-Adjust workloads or travel expectations

-Provide better support and work flexibility
